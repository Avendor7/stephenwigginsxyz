                    Stephen Wiggins is the Boss Bacon. He calls all the shots inside the office. Why is he Boss Bacon? Because he's the <strong>BOSS</strong>                    and everything is better with Bacon. Stephen Wiggins is a master at the server side of web applications
                    and rules his area of experties like a Boss. He handles the day to day operations as well as helps keep
                    this site running. His work allows you to place orders, and see what it is we have in stock. He is the
                    one that ultimately makes the decision of what we sell and for how much. Make no mistake, Wiggins may
                    be the <strong>BOSS</strong> Bacon but when the chips are down and things need to get done, you'll find
                    him with the rest of the team down in the trenches.

                    Stephen Wilson aka Jensen is a security guru. Dispite his skills, he has said that, <strong>&quot;<i>I never asked for this.</i>&quot;</strong>                    He keeps all of your data safe and secure. Pro tip, do not try and test him, bad things tend to happen.
                    Wilson is a veratble one man army in data security. He is in charge of the security on this site and
                    some belive he has helped wire up the security in the office. Wilson takes the security game to new heights
                    and is always on top of the ever changing environments. Calm cool and collected Wilson is every bit as
                    determined as Jensen ever was. Even without the cybernetic implants and black coat Wilson is just as
                    awesome.
